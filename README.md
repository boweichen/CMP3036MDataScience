I teach data science and analytics related courses for undergraduate and postgraduate/master students in computer science school (previously) and business school (now). I mainly use the materials from the following list as the main references in my teaching (also in my research). They can be used as the directed study materials for students who want to develop their portfolio of data analytics and machine learning knowledge and skills. I will keep updating the list. Due to my limited knowledge, the contents are biased towards some specific fields or topics, and many good materials may not be included. If you think I have left something out that should be included in the list, any of your contributions is welcome and please get in touch with me at [Bowei.Chen@glasgow.ac.uk](Bowei.Chen@glasgow.ac.uk). 

### Machine Learning and Data Science (Theory)

#### Probability, Statistics and Linear Algebra (Fundamental Mathematics)

I studied mathematical finance and statistics in postgraduate studies, and then self-studied machine learning since my PhD research. The following are the fundamental mathematics materials which I read and use(d) in my study and teaching. Clearly, probability and statistics play a significant role. However, it should be noted that many topics covered by these books are not very popular or widely used in machine learning and data science. 

- Walter Rudin. *Principles of Mathematical Analysis*, McGraw-Hill, 3rd Edition, 1976
- David Freedman. *Statistical Models: Theory And Practice*, Cambridge University Press, 2nd Edition, 2009
- Morris DeGroot and Mark Schervish. *Probability and Statistics*, Pearson, 4th Edition, 2013
- George Casella and Roger Berger. *Statistical Inference*, 2nd Edition, 2002
- Sheldon Ross. *Introduction to Probability Models*, Academic Press, 10th Edition, 2009
- Geoffrey Grimmett, David Stirzaker. *Probability and Random Processes*, Oxford University Press, 2001
- Alexander Mood, Franklin Graybill, Duane Boes. *Introduction to the Theory of Statistics*, 3rd Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1974

The following two books provide a good exposition of the essential mathematics of machine learning. I recommend them for those who want to study the theory of machine learning algorithms:

- Gilbert Strang. *Linear Algebra and Learning from Data*, Cambridge University Press, 2018 [[Link](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/)] 
- Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong. *Mathematics for Machine Learning*, Cambridge University Press, 2020. [[Link](https://mml-book.github.io/)]

#### Machine Learning and Data Mining (Introductory Level)

I recommend the following two books for students in business background who do not know what is data science and machine learning and want to get a grasp on the big picture. 

- Andrew Ng. *Machine Learning Yearning*, 2018 [[Link](https://www.deeplearning.ai/machine-learning-yearning/)]
- Pedro Domingos. *The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World*, Allen Lane, 2015

The following books are easy to follow. I recommend them for students in business background as the first book to study machine learning and data science. I use several materials from Gareth James's book in my teaching at business schools. 

- Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, Jian Pei. *Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques*, Morgan Kaufmann, 3rd Edition, 2011
- Nong Ye. *Data Mining: Theories, Algorithms, and Examples*, CRC, 2014

#### Machine Learning and Data Mining (Intermediate and Advanced Level)

This part is mainly for machine learning theory. They are suitable for undergraduates, postgraduates, PhDs and mature researchers. I widely use materials for my research and teaching from the books by David MacKay, Christopher Bishop, Kevin Murphy, Yaser Abu-Mostafa, Hang Li, and Zhihua Zhou. As a researcher, I am on my way to explore other books in depth, e.g., Ian Goodfellow's Deep Learning and Richard Sutton's Reinforcement Learning.

### Machine Learning and Data Science (Practice & Tools)

It is very difficult to compare the programming tools without knowing: 
- What do you plan to do?
- What is your preference of investment (mainly your time) and reward?
- Who you do work with and who do you want to present and share your work?

I have used Python, R, Matlab and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio for years in my research and teaching. The following are my humble experience. 

#### Python

I use Python a lot in my research. It is a high-level, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It is easy to learn, quite fast, and with a lot of machine learning libraries and a comprehensive range of codes online. I guess the latter two are the main reasons why Python has been extremely successful for machine learning and data analytics today. The following are just the introductory Python materials for those who have not used it before. 

- Wes McKinney. *Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython*, O'Reilly, 2012
- Peter Harrington. *Machine Learning in Action*, Manning Publishing, 2012 [[Link](https://github.com/pbharrin/machinelearninginaction)]
- Jake VanderPlas. *Python Data Science Handbook Essential Tools for Working with Data*, O'Reilly, 2016 [[Link](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/)]
- Mofan Zhou. *莫烦 Python* [[Link](https://morvanzhou.github.io/)]
- Sebastian Raschka. *Python Machine Learning*, Packt Publishing, 2015
- Kevin Sheppard. *Introduction to Python for Econometrics, Statistics and Data Analysis*, University of Oxford Lecture Notes, 2014 [[Link](https://www.kevinsheppard.com)] 

#### R

In my research, I like to use R for: (i) quick descriptive analytics; and (ii) visualisation of experimental results. I knew R from S-Plus when I studied statistics courses many years ago. My experience of using R was not pleasant at the time. I was switching to Matlab and Mathematica for a couple of years until RStudio and ggplot2 came to me. R was developed mainly for statistical computing but in recent years it has been expanded for data science and machine learning. I am a fan of the R packages developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), which significantly improve my experience of using R. Therefore, I strongly recommend his R books series: 
- Hadley Wickham, Garrett Grolemund. *R for Data Science*, O'Reilly, 2016 [[Link](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)]
- Hadley Wickham. *ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis*, 2nd Edition, Springer, 2016 [[Link](http://ggplot2.org/book)]
- Hadley Wickham. *Advanced R*, CRC, 2014 [[Link](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)]

Other good R books include:
-  Julia Silge, David Robinson. *Text Mining with R*, O'Reilly, 2017 [[Link](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)]
- Deepayan Sarkar. *Lattice: Multivariate Data Visualization with R*, Springer, 2008 [[Link](http://lmdvr.r-forge.r-project.org/figures/figures.html)]
- Robert Kabacoff. *R in Action: Data Analysis and Graphics with R*, Manning Publications, 2015
- Deborah Nolan, Duncan Lang. *Data Science in R: A Case Studies Approach to Computational Reasoning and Problem Solving*, CRC, 2015

#### Matlab

Matlab was my favourite tool in my research. It is perhaps the most successful commercial software in mathematical programming. It is very powerful; has a user-friendly interface (debugging is easy and the generated figures are editable); is very good at simulating and modelling systems. Matlab has a File Exchange community while it is not as popular as the communities of Python and R. The license for Matlab can be costly though many universities and companies purchase Matlab licence each year for students, staff and researchers. The following two books I found very helpful when I used and taught Matlab for data analytics. 
- Wendy Martinez, Angel Martinez. *Computational Statistics Handbook with Matlab*, 3rd Edition, CRC, 2015
- Jaan Kiusalaas. *Numerical Methods in Engineering with Matlab*, 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2012

  
#### Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio

Some of my business school courses are for students who do not have received a lot of mathematical and/or programming trainings. Their primary goal is to quickly apply the popular machine learning algorithms for business analytics. Therefore, Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio can be an ideal tool. It allows users to build and deploy machine learning algorithms in a simple way by connecting the basic modules. R, Python and Jupyter notebooks can also be used in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio for making customised functions and analytics. Last but not least, Microsoft Azure Machine Learning offers free-usage tier and up to 10 GB of dataset storage space.
