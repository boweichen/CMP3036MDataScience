This list of resources was primarily intended to support the final-year CS undergraduate students at the University of Lincoln to construct their portfolio of data analytics/data science/machine learning knowledge and skills, where I taught courses *Data Science Techniques and Tools* and *Algorithms for Data Mining*. I keep this list as the extended reading for the MSc elective courses which I teach at the Adam Smith Busniess School of Univerity of Glasgow and other international summer school programmes. 

The list will be kept updated. Due to my limited knowledge, the contents are baised towards some specific fields and many good materials may not be included. If you think I have left something out that should be included in the list, any of your contributions is welcome and please get in touch with me at [Bowei.Chen@glasgow.ac.uk](Bowei.Chen@glasgow.ac.uk).
